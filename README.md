# Project Overview

Welcome to the v-Script-Generation project. In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
